# Advent of Code 2023

This repository includes my code for the [Advent of Code 2023](https://adventofcode.com/2023/about).

As i've begun my journey in learning how to program and enrolling into a school for it, i've decided
to put what im learning into practice with this year's Advent of Code, fully doing it in C.

*If you want to solve the puzzles yourself first, do so, **then** look for the solution to compare.*
Do **not** cheat yourself out of a great time and learning experience by just copying code!

**Please keep in mind most of this is hacked together.
I don't claim it's perfect code or even in all cases 100% valid/defined/proper code or whatever.
It's for fun and it got the job done in a short amount of time.** ðŸ˜€

I'll update this repository now and then to include all my solutions whenever I've got time to properly comment and upload it.

This is mostly for those that are curious.
If you want to look at the code, experiment with it, change it, etc. be my guest.
